## COURSE CATALOG SCRAPER
John Pridmore: Senior Capstone Final Project contribution
Scraper to generate courses to populate database so that algorithm can generate a path to graduation for masters students at DePaul.

* scrapes DePaul's internal oData xml endpoints to retrieve information on the courses offered that year at DePaul 
* when used in conjunction with boolean_expression_tree module also included on my github, it is capable of turning the strings used to represent course prerequisites into boolean expression trees.
